/**
 * <p>Contract that must be fulfilled such that an algorithm can be run in {@code Net2Plan}.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>New algorithms can be implemented as Java classes (.class/.jar files) with
 * a given signature. Integration of algorithms simply requires saving them in any
 * directory of the computer, although it is a good practice to store them in the
 * {@code \workspace} directory.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p><b>Important</b>: When algorithms are implemented as Java {@code .class} files,
 * the full path to the class must follow the package name of the class, in order
 * to successfully load the algorithm. For example, if we create an algorithm
 * named {@code testAlgorithm} in the package {@code test.myAlgorithms}, the full
 * path to the class must be like {@code ...{any}.../test/myAlgorithms/testAlgorithm.class}.
 * For {@code .jar} files there is not any restriction on the full path,
 * they can be stored at any folder.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>In order to improve the user experience, kernel is able to catch any exception
 * thrown by algorithms. Those exceptions are introduced in a Java error console
 * (see 'Help file' for more information). For example, exceptions allow users to
 * check if their algorithms are well-programmed (i.e. no null-pointers), thus in
 * the error console they got a full trace of the error (files, line numbers...).
 * However, when input parameters are wrong or an error within the algorithm is
 * returned (i.e. an optimization problem is unable to find feasible solutions),
 * we recommend to throw exceptions using the
 * {@link com.net2plan.interfaces.networkDesign.Net2PlanException Net2PlanException} class,
 * since it allows users to see the error in a small dialog in which the only
 * information is the error message (i.e. "A feasible solution was not found")
 * instead of the full error trace in the error console (i.e.
 * {@code RuntimeException: A feasible solution was not found (MyAlgorithm.java:35), ...}).</p>
